Introduction:

When you type a URL such as https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, an intricate series of processes happen behind the scenes before the Google homepage appears on your screen. In this post, we’ll dive deep into the technical steps, exploring concepts like DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, SSL/TLS, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.

1. DNS Request:
The first step involves the DNS (Domain Name System).

When you type https://www.google.com into your browser, your computer does not inherently understand that domain. The browser must first resolve this human-readable address to an IP address, which is required to send any requests over the network.
The browser checks if the IP address of google.com is already cached locally. If not, it sends a DNS request to a DNS server (usually provided by your ISP or public DNS providers like Google DNS or Cloudflare).
The DNS server responds with the IP address associated with www.google.com (for example, 172.217.11.174).
2. TCP/IP:
Once the browser has the IP address, the next step involves establishing a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection.

The browser initiates a TCP handshake with the server using the IP address it received.
This process establishes a reliable connection by ensuring that both the browser and the web server can communicate properly.
The handshake involves three steps:
SYN: The client sends a synchronize (SYN) request to start the connection.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a synchronize-acknowledgment (SYN-ACK).
ACK: The client sends an acknowledgment (ACK) to complete the connection.
Once the connection is established, the browser can send and receive data reliably.

3. Firewall:
After the TCP connection is established, your request may pass through a firewall.

Firewalls are used to filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.
Google’s firewall may check the request to ensure it meets security criteria (e.g., verifying that it comes from an authorized IP address).
If the request passes the firewall’s checks, it’s allowed to proceed. If not, the connection is rejected.
4. HTTPS/SSL:
Now, because the URL you’ve typed begins with https://, it indicates that the communication should be encrypted using SSL/TLS.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are protocols designed to secure communications over the internet.
The browser sends a SSL handshake to the server to initiate encryption. During this handshake:
The server sends its SSL certificate, which includes its public key.
The browser checks the certificate to ensure it’s valid and that the connection is secure.
The browser and server agree on a shared encryption key.
Once the SSL/TLS connection is established, all data transmitted between the client and server will be encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
5. Load Balancer:
At this point, your request may go through a load balancer.

Large-scale websites like Google use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple web servers.
The load balancer ensures that no single server is overwhelmed with too much traffic, improving the performance and reliability of the website.
Depending on the load balancer’s algorithm (round-robin, least connections, etc.), it directs your request to the appropriate server.
6. Web Server:
The load balancer sends your request to one of Google’s web servers.

Web servers are responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving static content (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files).
The web server receives your request for https://www.google.com and processes it.
If your request is for a static resource, the server sends it directly back to your browser.
7. Application Server:
For dynamic content (e.g., Google’s search functionality), the web server forwards the request to an application server.

Application servers host the backend code that generates dynamic content. For example, Google’s search results.
These servers handle business logic, user authentication, and request processing.
The application server may retrieve data from databases or other services to generate the required content.
8. Database:
Some requests may require the application server to interact with a database.

Google stores a vast amount of data, such as indexed web pages, user preferences, or search history.
When you perform a search, for instance, the application server queries a database to retrieve relevant information or search results.
The database response is returned to the application server, which then generates the necessary dynamic content.
Conclusion:
After the application server generates the response, it returns the data to the web server, which sends it back to your browser via the established TCP/IP connection. The encrypted data is decrypted, and you see the Google homepage (or search results) on your screen.

Each of the technologies involved in this process, from DNS resolution to database queries, plays an essential role in ensuring that you can access websites securely and efficiently.
